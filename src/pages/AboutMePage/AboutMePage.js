          Ever since I was a little kid, computers has been my passion. I still remember sitting in front of my first PC and trying to fix it.
          As I grew up, during high school, I was curious about how computers actually works and how those programs could be developed, that was the moment when I discovered software development.
          I started to do read about programming language and to create my first programs.
        </h6>
        <h6 className="landing-about-me__content">
          This passion carried me to decide to study computer science. My beginnings in college were quite difficult but, having a good group of friends and thanks to them and my hard work, I was able to graduate and appreciate the importance of teamwork.
          I studied new languages, algorithms, mathematics and methodologies, all with practically the same fascination that drove me as a child. But of all the subjects I took, the one that caught my attention the most was web development, and it was at that moment that I really discovered my
          desire to become a frontend developer.

          So now, in industry, this passion remains with me. There's certainly yer more to learn, yet more problems to solve and, yer more to build. Your imagination and commitment are the only limit.
